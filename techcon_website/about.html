        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          It began in <strong>Lagos, Nigeria</strong>, in 2012. A small group of software engineers,
        designers, and tech entrepreneurs gathered in the back room of a modest co-working space
        in Yaba—what was then just beginning to earn its name as “Yabacon Valley.”
        </p>
        <p>
        Frustrated by the lack of platforms for pan-African tech collaboration, they asked a bold question:  
        <em>What if there was one event where African talent from every corner of the continent could meet, share, and build the future together?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        The first edition was grassroots—just 80 participants, unreliable power supply, and a projector that overheated every hour.
        But the atmosphere was electric. Among the early attendees was <strong>Ayo Kendi</strong>, a self-taught developer from Ibadan. 
        His prototype for a solar-powered IoT water sensor drew the attention of investors from Nairobi and Cape Town. 
        Today, Ayo runs a clean-tech startup operating across East and West Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
        From there, TechCon grew rapidly. By 2016, it had become a travelling conference, rotating across African cities—Accra, Kigali, Nairobi, Dakar—
        building a shared tech identity across borders and languages.
        </p>
        <p>
        Today, TechCon is more than a conference. It's a celebration of <strong>homegrown brilliance</strong>, a proving ground for big ideas,
        and a powerful reminder that the future of technology is being co-created across the continent.
